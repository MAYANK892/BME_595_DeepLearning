# Title 
Automatic Image captioning using Deep Learning

# Team Members
1. Vineeth C.R. (M.S. student in Industrial Engineering)
2. Mayank Gupta (M.S. student in Industrial Engineering)

# Goals
In this project, we will build a deep learning model to automatically generate the caption of the image. In order to implement this problem, we will utilize Convolutional Neural Networks coupled with Recurrent Neural network to generate a text describing the content in the image. For the purpose of training this model, we will use a server with GPU in our lab and we will utilize Microsoft's COCO (common object in context) dataset for the same.

# Challenges
The biggest challenge is to come up with a standard evaluation metric for identifying the accuracy of the caption. Some of the other challenges could be:
1. Proper segmentationb and localization of the image
2. Understanding different components in the image to generate the "right" caption
